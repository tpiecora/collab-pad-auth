# Collab-Pad

`Collab-Pad` is a sample application that allows for live document collaboration.
Users can create their own documents and invite others to participte with them, and can be invited by other users to participate in their documents.

This project was seeded with the excellent [sails-angular-jwt-example](https://github.com/Foxandxss/sails-angular-jwt-example), though sails and dependencies were updated to latest version.
